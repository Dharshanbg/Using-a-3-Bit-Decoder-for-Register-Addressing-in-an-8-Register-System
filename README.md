# Using-a-3-Bit-Decoder-for-Register-Addressing-in-an-8-Register-System
In COA, an 8-register system uses a 3-bit decoder for register selection and a 4-bit multiplexer for 16 operations. Incrementors, decrementors, and splitters manage execution and memory access. A program counter handles sequential instructions, while bit extenders ensure data compatibility for shifts and rotates.
