# COMPUTER ORGANISATION AND ARCHITECTURE
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design and simulate a 16- bit processor using 3- address format, which can perform Load/Store, Arithmetic & Logical operations on a set of data. Design for a Harward Architecture, separate code memory & separate data memory to store program instructions and operands respectively. Include all the control & status registers like PC (to hold address of instruction), MAR (to hold the memory address), MBR (to hold the data from memory), PSW (to hold status of condition codes) and IR (to decode the instruction). Include a Register file of 16 Registers (R0—R15). Include a data memory and code memory of suitable size. 
• Fetch the instruction using the contents of PC and update PC 
• Decode the instruction from IR 
• Fetch the operands 
• Execute the operation 
• Write the result back in the destination
